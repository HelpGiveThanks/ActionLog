'''''Sinterklaas''''' [sɪntər'klaːs] or ''Sint Nicolaas'' [sɪnt 'nikolaːs] [{{Pronunciation|Nl-Sint Nikolaas2.ogg}}] is a traditional winter holiday figure based on [[Saint Nicholas]]. Other names for the figure include ''De Sint'' ("The Saint"), ''De Goedheiligman'' ("The Good Holy Man"), and ''De Goede Sint'' ("The Good Saint") in Dutch; ''Saint-Nicolas'' in French; and ''Kleeschen'' and ''Zinniklos'' in Luxemburgish.

Sinterklaas is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on Saint Nicholas' eve (5 December) in the Netherlands and on the morning of 6 December, the [[Saint Nicholas Day|feast of Saint Nicholas]], in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine and Artois). He is also well known in territories of the former [[Dutch Empire]], including Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Indonesia, and Suriname.

He is one of the sources of the holiday figure of [[Santa Claus]].<ref name="Clark1998">{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Cindy Dell|title=Flights of Fancy, Leaps of Faith: Children's Myths in Contemporary America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HQNz-JLYOWkC&pg=PA25|accessdate=23 December 2013|date=1998-11-01|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226107783|pages=26–}}</ref>

Other holiday figures based on Saint Nicholas are celebrated in some parts of Germany and Austria (''Sankt Nikolaus''); Switzerland (''Samichlaus''); Italy (''San Nicola'' in [[Bari]], [[South Tyrol]], Alpine municipalities, and many others); parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia (''Sveti Nikola''); Slovenia (''Sveti Nikolaj'' or ''Sveti Miklavž''); and Greece (''Agios Nikolaos''), among others.

===Sinterklaas===

''Sinterklaas'' is an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or [[chasuble]] over a traditional white bishop's [[alb]] and sometimes red [[stola]], dons a red [[mitre]] and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured [[crosier]], a long ceremonial shepherd's staff with a fancy curled top.

He traditionally rides a white [[Gray (horse)|horse]]. In the Netherlands, the horse is called ''Amerigo'', and in Belgium, it is named ''Slecht Weer Vandaag'', meaning "Bad Weather Today".<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Encyclopedia of Observances, Holidays and Celebrations from MobileReference|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5VhTa1Eiq7oC|accessdate=8 February 2014|date=1 January 2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=|pages=}}</ref>

Sinterklaas carries a big book that tells whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year.

===Zwarte Piet===
[[File:Zwartepiet.png|thumb|170px|[[Zwarte Piet]]]]
{{Main|Zwarte Piet}}
A ''Zwarte Piet'' (Black Pete, plural ''Zwarte Pieten'') is a companion of Sinterklaas, usually portrayed by an adolescent in [[blackface]] with black curly hair, dressed up like a 17th-century ''page'' in a colourful dress, often with a [[lace]] collar, and donning a feathered cap.

Sinterklaas and his Black Pete usually carry a bag which contains candy for nice children and a ''roe'', a [[chimney sweep]]'s broom made of willow branches, used to spank naughty children. Some of the older Sinterklaas songs make mention of naughty children being put in the bag and being taken back to Spain. The ''[[Zwarte Piet]]en'' toss candy around, a tradition supposedly originating in Sint Nicolaas' story of saving three young girls from prostitution by tossing golden coins through their window at night to pay their [[dowry]]. In recent years the ''roe'' has been absent to adapt to modern times.

There are various explanations of the origins of the helpers. The oldest explanation is that the helpers symbolize the two ravens [[Huginn and Muninn]] who informed Odin on what was going on. In later stories the helper depicts the defeated [[devil]]. The devil is defeated by either Odin or his helper [[Nörwi]], the black father of the night. Nörwi is usually depicted with the same staff of birch ("''roe''") as Zwarte Piet. Another, more modern story is that Saint Nicolas liberated an Ethiopian slave boy called 'Piter' (from [[Saint Peter]]) from a [[Myra]] market, and the boy was so grateful he decided to stay with Saint Nicolas as a helper.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Zwarte Pieten have roughly the same relationship to the Dutch Saint Nicolas that the elves have to America's Santa Claus. According to tradition, the saint has a Piet for every function: there is a head piet (''Hoofdpiet''), navigation Pieten (''wegwijspiet'') to navigate the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands, packing Pieten (''pakjespiet'') to pack all the gifts, acrobatic Pieten to climb roofs and stuff presents down the chimney, or to climb down the chimneys themselves. Over the years many stories have been added, but over the years, ''Zwarte Piet'' developed from a rather unintelligent assistant into a full assistant of the [[absent-minded]] Sint.<ref>[http://nos.nl/artikel/565895-wie-is-die-zwarte-piet-eigenlijk.html nos.nl]; ''Wie is die Zwarte Piet eigenlijk?'', 23 October 2013</ref>

Traditionally their faces are blackened because Zwarte Piet is a Spanish (Moorish) servant of Sinterklaas (though some people said Zwarte Piet was originally a slave who, when Sinterklaas bought him his freedom, was so grateful that he stayed to assist him). Today, sometimes the more politically correct explanation that Pete's face is "black from [[soot]]" (as Pete has to climb through chimneys to deliver his gifts) is used. With the influx of immigrants to the Netherlands starting in the late 1950s, Zwarte Piet is felt by some to be racist.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071211174538/http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=6&story_id=2394 Expatica.com.]; Annual ''Zwarte Piet'' debate.

=== Arrival from Spain ===

Sinterklaas traditionally arrives in the Netherlands each year in mid-November (usually on a Saturday) by steamboat from Spain. He then parades through the streets on his horse, welcomed by children cheering and singing traditional Sinterklaas songs.<ref>{{cite web

After this national arrival, all towns with a dock usually celebrate their own ''intocht van Sinterklaas'' (arrival of Sinterklaas). Local arrivals usually take place later on the same Saturday of the national arrival, the next Sunday (the day after he arrives in the Netherlands or Belgium), or one weekend after the national arrival. In places a boat cannot reach, Sinterklaas arrives by train, horse, horse-drawn carriage or even a fire truck.

Some suggest that gifts associated with the holy man, the [[mandarin oranges]], led to the misconception that he must have been from Spain. This theory is backed by a Dutch poem documented in 1810 in New York and provided with an English translation:

'''Dutch'''<br />
Sinterklaas, goedheiligman!<br>
Trek uwe beste tabberd an,<br />
Reis daar mee naar Amsterdam,<br />
Van Amsterdam naar Spanje,<br />

The text presented here comes from a pamphlet that [[John Pintard]] released in New York in 1810. It is the earliest source mentioning Spain in connection to ''Sinterklaas''. Pintard wanted St. Nicholas to become patron saint of New York and hoped to establish a ''Sinterklaas'' tradition. Apparently he got help from the Dutch community in New York, that provided him with the original Dutch ''Sinterklaas'' poem. Strictly speaking, the poem does not state that Sinterklaas ''comes'' from Spain, but that he needs to ''go'' to Spain to pick up the oranges and pomegranates. So the link between Sinterklaas and Spain goes through the oranges, a much appreciated treat in the 19th century. Later the connection with the oranges got lost, and Spain became his home.

=== Period leading up to Saint Nicholas' Eve ===
[[File:Bag of pepernoten.JPG|thumb|170px|[[Kruidnoten]], small, round [[gingerbread]]-like [[cookie]]s]]
[[File:Chocoladeletter A.jpg|thumb|170px|A [[chocolate letter]], typical Sinterklaas candy in the Netherlands]]
In the weeks between his arrival and 5 December, Sinterklaas  also visits schools, hospitals and shopping centers. He is said to ride his white-grey horse over the rooftops at night, delivering gifts through the chimney to the well-behaved children. Traditionally, naughty children riske being caught by Black Pete, who carried a jute bag and willow cane for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnicholascenter.org/Brix?pageID=92|title=Sinterklaas traditions in the Netherlands}}</ref>

Before going to bed, children put their shoes next to the fireplace chimney of the coal-fired stove or fireplace (or in modern times close to the [[Radiator (heating)|central heating radiator]]). They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it and a bowl of water nearby "for Sinterklaas' horse", and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes. Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include [[hot chocolate]], [[mandarin orange]]s, [[pepernoot|''pepernoten'']], letter-shaped [[Banket (food)|pastry]] filled with [[almond paste]] or a [[chocolate letter]] (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), ''[[speculaas]]'' (sometimes filled with almond paste), [[Chocolate money|chocolate coins]] and ''[[marzipan]]'' figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.

=== Saint Nicholas' Eve and Saint Nicholas' Day===
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas' Eve, 5 December, became the chief occasion for gift-giving during the winter holiday season. The evening is called ''Sinterklaasavond'' or ''Pakjesavond'' ("gifts evening", or literally "packages evening").

On the evening of 5 December, the main presents will somehow arrive, or a note will be "found" that explains where in house the presents were hidden by Zwarte Piet who left a [[burlap]] sack with them. Sometimes a neighbor will knock on the door (pretending to be a Zwarte Piet) and leave the sack outside for the children to retrieve; this varies per family. When the presents arrive, the living room is decked out with them, much as on Christmas Day in English-speaking countries. On 6 December, Sinterklaas departs without any ado, and all festivities are over.

In Belgium, most children have to wait until the morning of 6 December to receive their gifts, and Sinterklaas is seen as a festivity almost exclusively for children. The shoes are filled with carrots and sugar cubes on the evening of the fifth and often, a bottle of beer for Zwarte Piet and a cup of coffee for Sinterklaas are placed next to them. ''Sinterklaas'' largely replaces Christmas as a gift-giving occasion, usually for as long as the children are living at home. Also, when it is time for children to give up their [[pacifier]], they place it into his or her shoe ("safekeeping by Sinterklaas") and it is replaced with chocolate the next morning.

The present is often creatively disguised by being packaged in a humorous, unusual or personalised way. This is called a ''surprise'' (from the French ).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.female-gamers.nl/news.php?extend.6774 |title=Artikel: Sinterklaas Gaming Surprises |language=Dutch |publisher=Female-Gamers.nl |date= 15 November 2011 |accessdate= 4 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.knutselidee.nl/startthema.htm?surprise |title=Examples of typical surprises |publisher=knutselidee.nl | language = [[Dutch language|Dutch]]}}</ref>

Poems from Sinterklaas usually accompany gifts, bearing a personal message for the receiver. It is usually a humorous poem which often teases the recipient for well-known bad habits or other character deficiencies.

When the children reach the age when they know "the big secret of Sinterklaas", some people will shift to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for the present giving. Older children in Dutch families where the children are too old to believe in Sinterklaas anymore, also often celebrate Christmas with presents instead of ''pakjesavond''. Instead of such gifts being brought by Sinterklaas, family members may draw names for an event comparable to [[Secret Santa]].

=== Pre-Christian Europe ===
Parallels have been drawn between the legend of ''Sinterklaas'' and the figure of [[Odin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historianet.nl/adventskalender/3-december-wat-heeft-sinterklaas-met-germaanse-mythologie-te-maken |title=Artikel: sinterklaas and germanic mythology |language=Dutch |publisher=historianet.nl |date= 3 December 2011 |accessdate= 8 December 2012}}</ref> a major god among the Germanic peoples, who was worshipped in Northern and Western Europe prior to Christianization. Since some elements of the ''Sinterklaas'' celebration are unrelated to Christianity, there are theories regarding the [[Paganism|pagan]] origins of various customs of the holiday stemming from areas where the Germanic peoples were Christianized and retained elements of their indigenous traditions, surviving in various forms into modern depictions of ''Sinterklaas''. Non-Christian elements in ''Sinterklaas'' that arguably could have been of pagan origin:
* Sinterklaas rides the rooftops on his white horse which has various names; Odin rides the sky with his grey horse [[Sleipnir]].
* Sinterklaas gives chocolate letters to children, like Odin gave the rune letters to man.
* Sinterklaas carries a staff and has mischievous helpers with black faces, who listen at chimneys to find out whether children are bad or good and report to Sinterklaas; Odin has a spear and his black ravens, [[Huginn and Muninn]], who report what happens in the world to Odin.<ref>McKnight, George Harley (1917).

=== Middle Ages ===
The ''Sinterklaasfeest'' arose during the Middle Ages. The folk feast celebrates the name day, 6 December, of [[Saint Nicholas]] (270–343), patron saint of children. Saint Nicholas was a Greek [[bishop]] of [[Myra]] in present-day Turkey. In 1087, half of his relics were furtively transported to [[Bari]], in southeastern Italy; for this reason, he is also known as Nikolaos of Bari. Bari later formed part of the Spanish [[Kingdom of Naples]], because it was previously conquered in 1442 by Alfonso&nbsp;V of Aragon. The city thus became part of the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and later of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], until the 18th century.

Because half the remains of St. Nicholas were in Bari (then a Spanish city), in this tradition St. Nicholas comes from Spain and has a  black helper depicted as a [[Morisco]] page boy known as ''[[Zwarte Piet]]''. Because of the help he gave to sailors in his home town, ''Saint Nicolas'' was venerated as the patron saint of sailors, which is why he comes to the Netherlands on a [[steamboat]]. His anonymous gifts and kindness towards children had already secured him the patronage of children, by the elders of [[Lycia]], his home province. Sinterklaas' fame spread throughout Europe. The Roman Catholic Church made his name day a Church holiday. In the north of France, he became the patron saint of school children, then mostly in church schools.

In the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-17th-century Europe, many Protestants and others changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'', and the date for giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.<ref>Forbes, Bruce David, ''Christmas: a candid history'', University of California Press, 2007, ISBN 0-520-25104-0, pp. 68–79.</ref>

Sinterklaas is assisted by many mischievous helpers with black faces and colourful Moorish dresses. These helpers are called ''[[Zwarte Piet]]en'' (Black Pete(r)s). Although the character of Black Pete later came to acquire racial connotations, his origins were in the evil figure. Good and bad play an important role in the feast: good is rewarded, bad and evil are punished. Hence the duplication of the one Saint in a saint and a (frolicking) devil.

The feast was both an occasion to help the poor, by putting money in their shoes (which evolved into putting presents in children's shoes) and a wild feast, similar to [[Carnival]], that often led to costumes, a "topsy-turvy" overturning of daily roles, and mass public drunkenness.

In early traditions, students elected one of their classmates as "bishop" on St. Nicholas Day, who would rule until 28 December (Innocents Day), and they sometimes acted out events from the bishop's life. As the festival moved to city streets, it became more lively.<ref name=Temple>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r8-X-quSAKYC&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=Jan+Schenkman+%281806%E2%80%931863%29&source=bl&ots=GiRiG-jCWt&sig=why1dXX83iqK6qCmThXgmgRmibg&hl=en&ei=C8tpTJTxMpqSnAep-rTBBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Jan%20Schenkman%20%281806%E2%80%931863%29&f=false|first1=Temple|last1=Hauptfleisch|author1-link=Temple Hauptfleisch|first2=Shulamith|last2=Lev-Aladgem|first3=Jacqueline|last3=Martin|first4=Willmar|last4=Sauter|first5=Henri|last5=Schoenmakers|title=Festivalising!: Theatrical Events, Politics and Culture|location=Amsterdam and New York|publisher=International Federation for Theatre Research|year=2007|page=291|accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>

=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
After the rebellion of the Dutch provinces against the [[Spanish Empire]], Calvinist regents and ministers prohibited celebration of the Saint. The [[Republic of the United Provinces]] became an officially [[Protestant]] country following the [[Reformation]], and its governments abolished public celebrations. The South, however, remained Catholic. People there and students in Amsterdam, which also contained a significant Catholic population, protested. The government eventually allowed private family celebration of Saint Nicholas' Day.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the saint emerged from hiding and became more secularized at the same time.<ref name=Temple /> The modern tradition of ''Sinterklaas'' as a children's feast was likely confirmed with the illustrated children's book ''Sint Nicolaas en zijn knecht'' ('Saint Nicholas and his servant'), written in 1850 by the teacher Jan Schenkman (1806–1863). Some say he introduced the images of Sinterklaas' delivering presents by the chimney, riding over the roofs of houses on a [[Gray (horse)|grey]] horse, and arriving from Spain by [[steamboat]], then an exciting modern invention. Perhaps building on the fact that Sint Nicholas historically is the patron saint of the sailors (many churches dedicated to him have been built near harbors), Schenkman could have been inspired by the Spanish customs and ideas about the saint when he portrayed him arriving via the water in his book. Schenkman introduced the song ''Zie ginds komt de stoomboot'' ("Look over yonder, the steamboat is arriving"), which is still popular in the Netherlands.

In Schenkman's version, the medieval figures of the mock devil, which later changed to Oriental or Moorish helpers, was portrayed for the first time as black African and called ''Zwarte Piet'' (Black Peter).<ref name=Temple />

=== World War II ===
In the lean times of the [[German occupation of the Netherlands]] (1940–1945), ''Sinterklaas'' nonetheless came to cheer everyone, not just children. Many of the traditional ''Sinterklaas'' rhymes written during those times<ref>Some of these were collected, published in 2009 by Hinke Piersma, a researcher at the [[Dutch Institute for War Documentation]].</ref> referred to current events. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was often celebrated. In 1941, for instance, the RAF dropped boxes of candy over the occupied Netherlands. One classical poem that was turned into a contemporary one was the following:

:original
:''Sinterklaas, kapoentje,''
:''Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,''
:''Gooi wat in mijn laarsje,''
:''Dank U Sinterklaasje''

:which became the contempory version
:''R.A.F. Kapoentje,''
:''Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,''
:''Bij de Moffen gooien,''
:''Maar in Holland strooien!''

:translation
:R.A.F. Capon,
:throw something in my shoe
:throw [bombs] at the Krauts
:but scatter [candy] in Holland!

This is a variation of one of the best-known traditional Sinterklaas rhymes, with "R.A.F." replacing "''Sinterklaas''" in the first line, (the two expressions have the same metrical characteristics in the first and second, and in the third and fourth lines) with the Dutch word "''Kapoentje''" [[capon]] is traditional in the rhyme, (but in this case it also alludes to "flying bird"). The second line is straight from the original rhyme, but in the third and fourth line the RAF is encouraged to drop bombs on the ''Moffen'' (slur for Germans, like "krauts" in English) and candy over the Netherlands. Many of the ''Sinterklaas'' poems of this time noted the lack of food and basic necessities, and the German occupiers having taken everything of value; others expressed admiration for the [[Dutch Resistance]].<ref>{{Cite news

Originally ''Sinterklaas'' was only accompanied with one (or sometimes two) ''Zwarte Pieten'', but just after the liberation of the Netherlands, Canadian soldiers organized a Sinterklaas party with many Zwarte Pieten, and ever since this has been the custom, each Piet normally having his own dedicated task.<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der (2009) ''Cookies, Coleslaw, and Stoops''.

==Sinterklaas as a source for Santa Claus==
''Sinterklaas'' is the basis for the North American figure of [[Santa Claus]]. It is often claimed that during the [[American War of Independence]], the inhabitants of New York City, a former Dutch colonial town ([[New Amsterdam]]), reinvented their ''Sinterklaas'' tradition, as Saint Nicholas was a symbol of the city's non-English past.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jona Lendering |url=http://www.livius.org/ne-nn/nicholas/nicholas_of_myra3.html#New |title=Saint Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Santa Claus |publisher= [[Livius.org]] |date= 20 November 2008 |accessdate= 4 December 2011}}</ref> The name Santa Claus supposedly derived from older Dutch ''Sinter Klaas''.

In his 1812 revisions to ''A History of New York'', Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon{{spaced ndash}} a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus.

But was Irving the first to revive the Dutch folklore of Sinterklaas? In New York, two years earlier [[John Pintard]] published a pamphlet with illustrations of [[Alexander Anderson (illustrator)|Alexander Anderson]] in which he calls for making Saint Nicholas the patron Saint of New York and starting a Sinterklaas tradition. He was apparently assisted by the Dutch because in his pamphlet he included an old Dutch Sinterklaas poem with an English translation. In the Dutch poem, Saint Nicholas is referred to as 'Sancta Claus'.<ref name="stnicholascenter.org"/> Ultimately, his initiative helped ''Sinterklaas'' to pop up as Santa Claus in the Christmas celebration, which returned{{spaced ndash}} freed of episcopal dignity and ties{{spaced ndash}} via England and later Germany to Europe again.

The Saint Nicholas Society of New York celebrates a feast on 6 December to this day. The town of Rhinebeck in [[Dutchess County, New York]], which was founded by Dutch and German immigrants, has an annual Sinterklaas celebration.

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer from Sinterklaas to the Christ Child or ''[[Christkindl]]'' (corrupted in English to Kris Kringle). Similarly, the date of giving gifts changed from 5 or 6 December to Christmas Eve.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Forbes |first=Bruce David |title=Christmas: A Candid History |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=0-520-25104-0 |pages= 68–79}}</ref>
