Script Steps

    #PURPOSE on the normal record view layouts the user is shown a total linkID number underlined to indicated that it is a button and a view button for all total and grand total records. These two buttons -- linkID number and view -- activate this script whose purpose is to 1) navigate from the current layout to the totalview layout, and 2) find and display the linked records. For example, the user may have several leg exercises they do each tracked by separate record and all of them totaled in one leg exercise total record. Clicking on the view button for the total record or the linkID number of this total record displayed next all the leg exercise records will activitate this script with result being the display of just these leg exercise records and the leg exercise total record. The user could take advantage of this feature to hide the leg exercise records displaying only the total record and when they wish to record leg exercise time, the user could click the view button see all the associated records, update them and then return to the main screen in which once again only the total record (now updated with new time) would be shown (along with all the other records the user wants to see.

Script Steps

    #PURPOSE add selected record's time data to an existing grand total record. (This will essentially involve deleting all the grand total's day records first because we are not adding the brainstate time for a particular day to the grand total for that day; we are instead adding the total of a day to the grand total which may include time from another brainstate day record that is already included in the grand total. For example: if on a particular day the current total is 1 hour and the grand total is 1 hour and we are adding to the total (not the grand total) 1 hour from another brainstate, if we did not delete the current grand total which is already 1, adding the new total of 2 hours (1 hour from each of the days it now accounts for) would make it 3 hours! Thus we first delete the old grand total records so that the updated total records are properly accounted for by it.

Script Steps

    #PURPOSE calculate the total time for 31 days worth of time
    #
    #
    #
    #1 add 30 days to the users selection of the day desired to start the month. (Day 1 is the day the user is currently looking at on the day view layouts. In order to give the user on the week and month view layouts a calendar going from 1 to 7 or 31 it is neccessary to put the Day 1 field at the far right, or furtherest from the titles of the records. The user expects to to select the day they want to see by clicking on the day field closest to do the titles, which is day 7 on the week and day 31 on month view. So this script setp captures this left most choice and adds the 6 or 30 to it and applies it to the day 1 field.)
    Set Field [ reference::day1; reference::day31Calc + 30 ]
    #
    #2 capture user's current date perference for starting the month
    Set Field [ steward::chosenMonth; reference::day1 ]
    #
    #3 refresh the layout so that the key fields for each record will be recalculated based on the new day selected. The date and times shown for each record are in a table related to each brainstate record by their dates. The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

(For some reason, when you select a new value in the go or scale dropdown lists, filemaker goes into a lengthy re-calc of all the barcharts on the layout, even though these drop downs are not connected in anyway with any of the record being calculated. To prevent this form happening, this script makes filemaker freeze the window and go to another layout. This other layout has a script layout trigger that causes the user to be returned to the layout that they just left. This back and forth between layouts seems to stop the recalc process from occuring.)

So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

Script Steps

    #PURPOSE go to time Total layout 1
    #
    #
    #
    #1 go to time layout 1
    Go to Layout [ “TotalMain” (brainstate) ]
    #
    #2 go to user's chosen day
    Set Field [ reference::day1; steward::chosenDayTotal ]
    #
    #3 refresh the layout so that the key fields for each record will be recalculated based on the new day selected. The date and times shown for each record are in a table related to each brainstate record by their dates. The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)
    Refresh Window [ Flush cached join results ]
    #
    #4 sort records (neccessary because the week and month view usually show more active records than the day view that need to be sorted out of top of list), and go to the first record.

So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

    #PURPOSE prevent huge time delay. (For some reason, when you select a new value in the go or scale dropdown lists, filemaker goes into a lengthy re-calc of all the barcharts on the layout, even though these drop downs are not connected in anyway with any of the record being calculated. To prevent this form happening, this script makes filemaker freeze the window and go to another layout. This other layout has a script layout trigger that causes the user to be returned to the layout that they just left. This back and forth between layouts seems to stop the recalc process from occuring.)

The date and times shown for each record are in a table related to each brainstate record by their dates. The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)

The date and times shown for each record are in a table related to each brainstate record by their dates. The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)
