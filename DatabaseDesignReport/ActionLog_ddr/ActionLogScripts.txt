The date and times shown for each record are in a table related to each brainstate record by their dates. The key date fields for all brainstate records are calculations where the value equals the reference field date shown at the top of the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So when the user changes the date in the reference field (top colored box) and then this script refreshes the database, all the brainstate records including the ones not shown recalculate their key fields, the result being they all take in the new date. This means that the related day records now change too to show the user the day records that match the updated brainstate record keys. (These day fields are locked to their related brainstate records by the brainstate records ID number. Using these to keys, the database is able to return the desired day fields for brainstate record the user elects to view at any one time.)
