#PURPOSE determine if user really wants to delete the selected record and delete that record if true.

#
#NOTE: the three # symbols set apart chunks of script.
#NOTE: the finish and error script chunks are almost identical (the error message differ in telling where in the script they occur). For this reason,
they are not numbered as part of a particular chuck of the script, and are separated by three # symbols to set them apart.
