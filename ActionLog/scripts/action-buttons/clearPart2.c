#PURPOSE just like on a stopwatch, this script activated by the clear button deletes the time recorded for a brainstate record's related day
record. Rather than just return the time to zero, this scripts deletes the record in case the user made a mistake in starting a timer for a
particular brainstate record and will not be using it at all, in which case if it is not deleted, this unused record will fill up the database wasting
space.

#1 check to insure that there is a record to clear and if not hast the script, then check to insure if there is a record that it is not a total or grand
total record. These total records are sums of other records and so their times are not created by the stopwatch script and should not be
cleared by this script. They will be cleared if there linked records' times are cleared by the UpdateTime script.
