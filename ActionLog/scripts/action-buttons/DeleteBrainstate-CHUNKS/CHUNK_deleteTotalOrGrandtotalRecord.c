action buttons: DeleteBrainstate CHUNKS: CHUNK_deleteTotalOrGrandtotalRecord
#PURPOSE delete a total or grand total record and also clear the linked records of their link to it (the records that add up to the total/grandtotal
being deleted).
#CHUNK USED BY DeleteBrainstate Script
#
#
#
#NOTE: the three # symbols set apart chunks of script.
#NOTE: the ﬁnish and error script chunks are almost identical (the error message differ in telling where in the script they occur). For this reason,
they are not numbered as part of a particular chuck of the script, and are separated by three # symbols to set them apart.

the user can still complete the delete process. If the record was deleted before the links the where deleted and the computer crashed,
those linked records would forever be linked to the now deleted total record unless the user could directly access the data table.)
