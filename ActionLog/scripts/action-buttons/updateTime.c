#HISTORY AND NEEDED CHANGES: This script
#used to help the ActionLog keep track of 1)
#grandtotal records, 2) timer total records,
#and timer records. In testing, this way of
#helping the user group activities by time was
#too imprecise, and so I created the Specific
#Action module, making 1) timers in the main
#timer window function as grand total timers,
#of 2) specific action total group times, and
#finally 3) specific actions times as the
#smallest record of user time.
# The grandtotal and total script steps,
#layouts, and fields nave never been removed.
#They will be when time permits. These
#BEGIN and END statements below I am using
#to flag questionable (deletable?) script steps.
#BEGIN Cleanup, answer why?, delete unused steps, etc.
#END Cleanup, answer why?, delete unused steps, etc.
#
#Specifically, this script updates time for all
#timers because user could have dragged time
#into timers other than the one they have
#currently selected.
#
#
#If user clicked the clear button but was in a field
#the clearPart1 script when it exits this field will
#trigger this script, which must be exited for the
#clearPart1 script to continue.
