show marked records. This field also is used to format the hide and show buttons to visually tell the user which of the two is
currently selected, or if neither of the two is selected (this field is blank).

#2 if the hide status is blank and the user clicks the hide button then they want to hide records records marked hide (hide=t), so find
only blank records, will have the effect of omitting all non-blank records.
