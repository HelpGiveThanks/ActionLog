#PURPOSE go forwards 1 day

#
#
#1 add one the current date.
Set Field [ reference::day1; reference::day1 + 1 ]
#
#2 refresh the layout so that the key fields for each
#record will be recalculated based on the new day
#selected. The date and times shown for each
#record are in a table related to each brainstate
#record by their dates. The key date fields for all
#brainstate records are calculations where the value
# equals the reference field date shown at the top of
#the screen in the green, red, or yellow box. So
#when the user changes the date in the reference
#field (top colored box) and then this script
#refreshes the database, all the brainstate records
#including the ones not shown recalculate their key
# fields, the result being they all take in the new
#date. This means that the related day records now
# change too to show the user the day records that
#match the updated brainstate record keys. (These
# day fields are locked to their related brainstate
#records by the brainstate records ID number.
# Using these two keys, the database is able to return
# the desired day fields for the brainstate record the
#user elects to view at any time.)

time value. The point is to keep the focus where the user expects it to be so the sort, which removes the focus from the current record is
only done if the user wants the records sorted by time, in which case after the sort the focus is returned to the first record.
