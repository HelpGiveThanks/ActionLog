#PURPOSE prevent huge time delay. (For some reason, when you select a new value in the go or scale dropdown lists, ﬁlemaker goes into a
lengthy re-calc of all the barcharts on the layout, even though these drop downs are not connected in anyway with any of the record being
calculated. To prevent this form happening, this script makes ﬁlemaker freeze the window and go to another layout. This other layout has
a script layout trigger that causes the user to be returned to the layout that they just left. This back and forth between layouts seems to
stop the recalc process from occuring.)
