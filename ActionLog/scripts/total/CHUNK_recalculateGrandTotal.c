total: CHUNK_recalculateGrandTotal
#PURPOSE add selected record's time data to an existing grand total record
#CHUNK USED BY DeleteBrainstate Script
#CHUNK USED BY seperateFromTotal Script
#CHUNK USED BY CHUNK_deleteRecordsTimeFromGrandtotal Script
#
#
#
#NOTE: the three # symbols set apart chunks of script.
#NOTE: the finish and error script chunks are almost identical (the error message differ in telling where in the script they occur). For this reason,
they are not numbered as part of a particular chuck of the script, and are separated by three # symbols to set them apart.

what happened is the find came up with zero records and then displayed all the records in the database and the next step deleted them.
This If check will prevent that from happening again if that is what happened. I have been unable to duplicate this massive error, so this
might not be reason why all the records where deleted, but this is the only time when the database is told to delete all found records, rather
than just one record, so I figure it must have been caused here.)
