#This field is for sorting the records by category
#to get the subtotal of each categories time.
# (The subtotal calculation depends on this "break"
# field to know which set of records should be
# treated as a subset of the total records shown.)
#This sort must be done on a field in the table
#where the time is located: list table.
#The system is using the text field from the list
#table for the text of each issue. Another occurance
#of the list table is used to supply the categories
#which are located in a different list table record.
#This allows the system to use the list table for
#Text and for tags: category and issue tags.
#However, in order to sort on the text of the
#category a copy of the text must be made
#part of each list record shown as an issue
# (instead of being shown as a category or status)
#This next field holds the copy of the cateogry
#tag text for each list record holding issue data.
